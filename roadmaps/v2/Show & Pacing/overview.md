# Show & Pacing — Overview

## Goals

- TV continues to feel like a host: clear beats, celebrations, “what matters now”.
- Phones get just-in-time guidance with minimal clutter.
- Moment logic is shared so 3D animations and UI overlays stay in sync.

## Dependencies

- Existing show layer in TV should remain stable.
- 3D renderer should expose hooks to trigger animations from “moments”.

## Phases

- Phase 1 (P1): Shared moment detector (TV + phone + 3D hooks)
- Phase 2 (P1): Host script + segment polish (text-only, Jackbox-style pacing)
- Phase 3 (P2): Attract mode + tutorial shorts + highlight reel
