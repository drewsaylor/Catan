# Feedback & Iteration — Overview

## Goals
- Capture feedback from playtest sessions in a privacy-friendly way.
- Provide simple rating and optional text feedback at game end.
- Track session analytics (duration, player count, completion rate) locally.
- Generate post-playtest reports to identify patterns for future roadmaps.
- No PII collection; all data stored locally in DATA_DIR/feedback/.

## Dependencies
- Game end flow for feedback prompt integration.
- DATA_DIR structure for feedback storage.

## Phases
- Phase 1 (P0): Feedback Collection Setup
- Phase 2 (P1): Session Analytics (Privacy-Friendly)
- Phase 3 (P2): Post-Playtest Report Generator
