# Performance & Feel — Overview

## Goals
- Optimize for smooth gameplay on real devices (phones and TV).
- Improve interaction responsiveness (button feedback, tap latency).
- Reduce load times and memory usage.
- Profile and optimize 3D rendering performance.
- Maintain 60fps on TV, 45fps+ on mid-range phones.

## Dependencies
- V2 3D Board & Motion (Phase 1+) for 3D performance work.
- Production Quality phases from V2 for baseline quality scaling.

## Phases
- Phase 1 (P0): Interaction Polish
- Phase 2 (P0): Memory & Load Time
- Phase 3 (P1): 3D Performance Tuning
