# Resource Icons (SVG + PNG)

These should match the existing “friendly boardgame resource icon” vibe: bold outline, subtle gradients, slight ground shadow. Keep the silhouette readable in a small chip.

Each resource includes SVG + PNG prompts that output **two variants**: Night UI + Tabletop Daylight.
