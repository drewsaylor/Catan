# UX Improvements — Overview

## Goals
- Shorten time-to-first-turn (“TV up, phones in, go”).
- Make edge cases non-dramatic: room full, room restarted, reconnect loops.
- Add a “session loop”: rematch/new game without rejoining.

## Phases
- Phase 1 (P0): Join improvements (QR + room state clarity)
- Phase 2 (P1): Coach system v2 (“Why can’t I?”)
- Phase 3 (P1): Post-game stats + rematch
